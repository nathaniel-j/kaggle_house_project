# kaggle_house_project
my first submission notebook for a Kaggle machine learning competition

Although this project turned out to not be as fruitful as I had hoped as a submission, the insights that I gained in the process were incredibly valuable. This notebook itself is the result of several edits and multiple tangental notebooks that I started each time I had a new inpspired lead to chase. At one point I had 6 different notebook clones running, each with a slightly different approach. My biggest takeaways from this project are the following:

1) ### I spent way too much time deep diving into the individual features and familiarizing myself with the data and not enough time running the different models. 
  - My original purpose for this was to put out a high performing machine learning model with my prime focus being on thorough feature analysis. What I found was that while the thoroughness of the analysis was very time consuming, it did not seem to give me the competitive advantage I had hoped to see. In the future I think that a better approach might be to set up a viable ML model as quickly possible and then come back and spend time improving performance with feature analysis.

2) ### I want to develop my knowledge of the SciKit Learn library approaches and methods.
  - Once I finally got my data processed and started running models I discovered that there is a whole lot more capability to this library than I was using. The ability to organize, manipulate, process, scale and transform the data all inside a pipeline that can run and cross-validate several model types with varying hyper-parameters is insanely powerful. However the documentation for the library is pretty useless and even scouring You Tube I couldn't find anyone that was teaching a systematic approach to Sklearn use. I think digging into this will prove invaluable.

3) ### I need to create a method for a focused workflow while still capturing ideas and questions that pop up along the way.
  - With this notebook I did try to outline my workflow right at the start, but I often found myself running away with small questions or spending extra time on ideas that werent even directly relevant. While I am sure that some of that will diminish over time as I find my rhythm, I do want to make a concious effort to make sure that I am streamlining my work as much as possible. Proficiency with Scikit learn will definitely help with that in the ML part, but I think having a systematic approach to analysis as well will benefit me and the end result will be better analysis.
